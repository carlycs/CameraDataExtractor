In general, Camera based data onlike other Point of Sales data, easily provides Validation to values that are otherwise not possible to capture. For example:
*What is the Real Waiting Time of any of your customers in a waiting line?
* What is the Arrival time and the decision making time for your customers before they make a purchase?


From operational point of view, this software creates Meta Data that were not possible before For example:

*Model of the Car
*Year of Car
*Color of Car

These new type of information can be helpful across departments like marketing whether it is for market research or decision makings involved in a business.
